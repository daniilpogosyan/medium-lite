## Dev notes
Plan:
  1. Query every fields (SELECT *) at first just to make that shit work
  2. Optional include post for user queries
  3. Optional include passwordHash for user queries
  4. Share options between service functions (getPost, getUser, ...)
  5. Fix inconsistency of id/ID/Id and user/author
